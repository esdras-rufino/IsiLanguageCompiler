# IsiLanguage Compiler

This repository contains a project for a compiler of the IsiLanguage that generates Java files. The compiler was developed using the Eclipse IDE along with the ANTLR plugin. The IsiCompiler and IsiLangVisitor classes were created to test the program. The input.isi file is written in the IsiLanguage and serves as a test for the required functions in the project.

IsiCompiler is a compiler project for IsiLanguage, a programming language created for teaching purposes. IsiLanguage is based on the Java language and has some optional functions, such as highlight, expr, generateTarget, apirest and interpreter.

IsiCompiler is able to translate (transpile) the IsiLanguage code into Java code, using the ANTLR tool and the Eclipse IDE. ANTLR is a tool that facilitates the creation of parsers and lexers from a grammar. Eclipse is an IDE that allows you to create, edit, run and debug software projects in different programming languages.

IsiCompiler has the following components:

- An IsiLanguage.g4 file that contains the IsiLanguage grammar in ANTLR format. Grammar defines the syntactic and semantic rules of the language, such as tokens, expressions, commands, etc.
- An IsiCompiler class that represents the main compiler driver. It uses the parser and lexer classes generated by ANTLR to parse the IsiLanguage code and generate Java code.
- An IsiLangVisitor class representing an IsiLanguage grammar visitor. It extends the AbstractParseTreeVisitor class and implements the IsiLangVisitor<T> interface, which are classes generated by ANTLR. It visits different parts of the abstract syntax tree (AST) generated by the parser and generates the corresponding Java code.
- An input.isi file that contains the IsiLanguage code that serves as a test for the compiler. It uses optional language functions such as highlight, expr, generateTarget, apirest and interpreter.

The IsiLangVisitor class is a class that represents a visitor of the IsiLanguage grammar, a programming language created for didactic purposes. IsiLanguage is based on the Java language and has some optional functions, such as highlight, expr, generateTarget, apirest and interpreter.

The IsiLangVisitor class is used to generate Java code from IsiLanguage code, using the Visitor design pattern. This pattern allows you to define an operation for each type of element in a complex structure, such as an abstract syntax tree (AST) generated by the grammar parser.

The IsiLangVisitor class extends the AbstractParseTreeVisitor class and implements the IsiLangVisitor<T> interface, which are classes generated by the ANTLR plugin for Eclipse. ANTLR is a tool that facilitates the creation of parsers and lexers from a grammar.

The IsiLangVisitor class has a visit method for each part of the IsiLanguage grammar, such as program, statement, command, expression, etc. Each visit method receives an AST node as a parameter and returns a value of type T. In the case of the IsiLangVisitor class, the type T is String, as the objective is to generate Java code in text format.

The IsiLangVisitor class also has some auxiliary attributes and methods to facilitate Java code generation, such as variable and function maps, methods to check types and scopes, methods to format the code, etc.

The IsiLangVisitor class is part of an IsiLanguage compiler project that generates Java files. The project was developed using the Eclipse IDE together with the ANTLR plugin. The IsiCompiler and IsiLangVisitor classes were created to test the program. The input.isi file is written in IsiLanguage and serves as a test case for the functions required in the project.

## Project Overview
The IsiLanguage compiler project consists of the following components:

IsiCompiler: This class represents the main compiler driver. It uses the ANTLR-generated parser and lexer to parse the input IsiLanguage code and generate Java code.

IsiLangVisitor: This class extends AbstractParseTreeVisitor and implements the visitor pattern for the IsiLanguage grammar. It visits different parts of the parse tree and generates the corresponding Java code.

ANTLR Plugin: The compiler was developed using the ANTLR plugin for Eclipse, which facilitates the generation of parser and lexer classes based on the grammar.

input.isi: This file contains IsiLanguage code and serves as a test input for the compiler.

## Optional Features Implemented
Editor Highlight
To simulate a small IDE, the compiler supports the highlight statement. For example:
highlight x;
This code highlights the variable x in the source code.
## Arithmetic Expression Evaluator
The compiler evaluates arithmetic expressions using the expr statement. For example:

expr = 1 + 2;
This code evaluates the arithmetic expression 1 + 2 and stores the result in the variable expr.

## Logical Operators
The compiler supports logical operators for decision-making. For example:

if (x > y) {
    // code
} else {
    // code
}
This code compares the values of x and y using logical operators and executes different code blocks based on the comparison.

## Generation of Multiple Target Languages
The compiler can generate code in multiple target languages using the generateTarget statement. For example:

prog = 'programa' decl bloco 'fimprog;';

// Generate Java source code
java = prog.generateTarget('java');

// Generate C++ source code
cpp = prog.generateTarget('cpp');

// Generate Python source code
python = prog.generateTarget('python');
This code generates Java, C++, and Python source code from the prog program.

## API Rest for Compiler Implementation
The compiler supports implementing a compiler using a REST API. For example:

apirest = 'apirest' AP ID SC;

// Implement a compiler using a REST API
compilar = apirest.implementarCompilador();
This code implements a compiler using a REST API.

## Interpreter (Runtime)
The compiler supports implementing an interpreter for the language using the interpretador statement. For example:

interpretador = 'interpretador' AP SC;

// Implement an interpreter for the language
interpretar = interpretador.implementarInterpretador();
This code implements an interpreter for the IsiLanguage.

## Additional Grammar Additions
The IsiLanguage grammar has been extended to support the following features:

highlight statement for code highlighting.
expr statement for evaluating arithmetic expressions.
OPREL token for logical operators.
generateTarget statement for generating code in multiple target languages.
apirest token for implementing a compiler using a REST API.
interpretador token for implementing an interpreter for the language.
Please refer to the IsiLanguage grammar file for the complete grammar with these additions.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Import the project into Eclipse.
Use the IsiCompiler and IsiLangVisitor classes to test the compiler and visit different parts of the grammar.
Feel free to explore and extend the project to further enhance the capabilities of the IsiLanguage compiler.
